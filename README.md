## 🧠 Project Overview
**The Challenge:**
Most electronics retailers suffer from information overload. Users are bombarded with specs, banners, and clutter, making premium products feel cheap.

**The Solution:**
I designed a "breathable" interface that treats electronics like luxury fashion items. The layout prioritizes high-quality photography, uses a strict "Zinc" dark-mode palette to reduce eye strain, and simplifies the decision-making process.

**My Role:** UI/UX Designer
**Tools Used:** Figma, Figma AI (for layout generation), Auto Layout

## 🎨 Design System & Visual Identity
To ensure consistency, I established a comprehensive style guide before starting the high-fidelity design.

| Category | Details | Reasoning |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Color** | `Zinc-950` (Dark) | Creates depth and feels more premium than pure black (`#000`). |
| **Typography** | `Inter` (Sans Serif) | Clean, legible, and technical. Tight tracking (`-2%`) adds an editorial feel. |
| **Iconography** | `Lucide Icons` | chosen for their clean stroke weights and readability. |
| **Grid** | `12-Column` (Desktop) | Ensures responsiveness across different screen sizes. |



## 📱 Key Interfaces

### 1. The Landing Page
Designed with a "Hero-First" approach. The navigation is minimized to focus user attention on the primary Call-to-Action (CTA).


### 2. Mobile Responsiveness
The grid adapts from 3-columns to 1-column. Touch targets (buttons) are enlarged to 44px minimum for accessibility.

## ⚡ Design Process
1.  **Discovery:** Analyzed competitors (Apple, Sony) to understand luxury aesthetics.
2.  **Wireframing:** Used Figma AI to rapidly generate layout iterations.
3.  **High-Fidelity:** Refined the best layout using Auto Layout for pixel-perfect spacing.
4.  **Prototyping:** Connected screens to simulate the "Add to Cart" and "Checkout" flows.
